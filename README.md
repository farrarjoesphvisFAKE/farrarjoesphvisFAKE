- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @farrarjoesphvisFAKE
- this account is dedicated towards awareness to @farrarjoesphv and many other fake accounts who claim to create video game "hacks", but actually just create a virus to steal your information :)
- i would love for people to spread awareness towards these kind of degenerates and what they do so that you dont install a computer virus thinking that it was a hack for one of your games!
- another way to avoid these is to JUST NOT HACK GAMES! its that simple! just dont be an annoying prick who wants to ruin the fun for everyone else!
